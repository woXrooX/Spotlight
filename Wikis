AF_INET vs PF_INET
  https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/programming-9/sockets-af_packet-versus-pf_packet-942143/

  AF_foo means address family foo, and PF_foo means protocol family foo.
  In Linux, they are always been the same values,
  I believe. Traditionally, the PF_foo constants were used for socket(),
  but AF_foo in the struct sockaddr structure.
  According to man 2 socket, even the (historical) BSD 4.x manpage states that "The protocol family generally is the same as the address family",
  and subsequent standards use AF_* everywhere.
  Thus, today, there really should be no difference between AF_foo and PF_foo.
